This is the workflow to download the last musicbrainz dump, 
setup a postgresql server, extract the relevant information
and upload it to s3.
It is not included in targets partly because it needs some
manual input and because it would not make sense to run it
at every iteration of musicbrainz. And also because I (Sam)
don't see how to do it easily.

Instruction:
Execute line by line install_mbslave.sh -- careful with the passwords.
Then cd in musicbrainz_sql and make.
